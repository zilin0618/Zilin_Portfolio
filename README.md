# Data Science Portfolio by Zilin Wang

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis and exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Python Projects

### [1. Sales Analysis Project](https://github.com/zilin0618/Sales_Analysis)
This is a simple practice of EDA by using Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I started by cleaning the data. Next, I move to the data exploration section, in this section 5 high level business questions were explored related to the data:
* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

* What city sold the most product?

* What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

* What products are most often sold together?

* What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions many different pandas & matplotlib methods were applieed. Detailed Code can be found by click the title or [here](https://github.com/zilin0618/Sales_Analysis/blob/master/Zilin%20Sales%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb).
